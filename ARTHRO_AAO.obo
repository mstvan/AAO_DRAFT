The posterior plate is fixed in position by its connections with the clypeus. The anterior plate fits against the concave side of the posterior plate and bears a ridge shaped apodeme (apodemal carina) that is attached to large dilator muscles that attach to clypeus. Their contraction pulls the anterior plate forward, enlarging the cibarial lumen and thus producing suction.

comment: DOS:  This term and definition look dodgy to me for a variety of reasons.  Seems odd to have  vagueness vs crispness of spatial boundaries as a differentium. A "3D region in space" does not have mass - even though this classified as an anatomical structure, which does.  'Compartmental boudary' has a specific meaning to developmental biologists that is presumably not intended here.

def: "An unpaired midline neuropil domain of the brain (syncerebrum) that is connected to the second order visual neuropils and postoral neuropils." [PMID:21062451]
comment: Strausfeld introduced the term arcuate body to denominate an unpaired midline neuropil in the chelicerate brain that had formerly been called the central body . The neuroanatomical evidence that distinguishes the arcuate body from the central body is mainly provided by its connectivity: unlike the arcuate body, the central body is only indirectly related to sensory neuropils and has no direct projections to postoral neuropils (Strausfeld, 1998; Strausfeld et al., 1993). Apart from cheliceates, an unpaired midline neuropil exhibiting a similarly close relationship to the visual system has also been described for the onychophoran species Euperipatoides rowelli (Strausfeld et al., 2006). (This comment is taken from Richter et al., 2010). {xref="PMID:18089068", xref="PMID:21062451", xref="PMID:7679123 ", xref="PMID:9787219"}

name: signal transduction

def: "The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.
